CS425 Game Final Project

The actual Final Project

Game Play:
    This is a stat-raising game set in prison where the player must convince 15 of the other prisoners within a week to incite a riot so the player can escape to go home for their childâ€™s birthday. 

Technical Component: 
    The main focus will be procedural content generation for creating different prisoners for the player to interact with. But I imagine there will be bits of AI in there as well since the player must convince each of the prisoners to be part of the riot.
